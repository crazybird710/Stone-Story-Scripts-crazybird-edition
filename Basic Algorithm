Basic Algorithm:
First, check location to get elemental priority.
Enemy priority: armored, ranged, swarm, immune to physical, immune to ranged.
Self priority: Armor, health.
In an elemental environment, if the player's armor is over 50, give the player the ability to use the dashing shield then switch to elemental B shield or socket shield.
If player's armor is under 50, switch to elemental A shield.
If immune to physical, default to magic elemental wand in L slot.
If player is damaged, default to big vigor lifesteal sword if enemy count over 3, else use vigor lifesteal sword.
If not immune to physical, default to big elemental sword if not
If enemy is non-elemental, default to vigor lifesteal weapon depending on enemy count.
  If enemy not immune to ranged, default to vigor lifesteal crossbow.
  If enemy immune to ranged, default to big vigor lifesteal sword if enemy count over 3, else use vigor lifesteal sword.
